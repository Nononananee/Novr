# faiss-cpu is OK to install here (CPU build).
# torch is large and often pulls CUDA-enabled wheels; install it manually
# in the environment where you need it (CPU-only example below).
# To install CPU-only torch after the venv is created, run:
#   /workspaces/Novr/.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
#   /workspaces/Novr/.venv/bin/python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch

# Add other heavy/sensitive packages here
